What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	No commits are made. You must make your own commit. This is because you may not want to commit all files and allows you to add your own commit comment.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is an intermediate directory where you can place the files you want to commit. This allows much more control over what gets committed.
